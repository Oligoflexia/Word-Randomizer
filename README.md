# Word-Randomizer

A (very) simple console based python application which takes a CSV of words (and their definitions) in lexicographic order and provides you a desired number of them in a randomized order for review purposes.

### Features:
- You can insert your own word list.
   - Make sure that the script is changed so that it points to the new list of words.csv
   -  Delete the .pickle files in the Data folder if you are using new words or want to restart your review.
 
- The app remembers where you left off.
